# Typst Template for SUSTech UG Thesis<br/>南科大本科生毕业设计Typst模版

![sustech-ug-thesis-typst](./resources/images/cover.png)

The full PDF file is available [here](./resources/sample.pdf), which includes the basic syntax of Typst.

## Usage

The templates in both languages are crafted based on the 
[official template](https://tao.sustech.edu.cn/studentService/graduation_project.html), but discrepancies exist between 
this template and the formal guideline. (I myself used this template in my ug thesis and there weren't any problems for 
me though.) If you come across a problem, please raise an issue or consider fixing it and raising a pull request.

- Install the latest version of [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst). It's way easier and faster than Latex!
- Download and extract the entire project
- Modify `metadata.typ` and `thesis.typ`
- Run `typst compile thesis.typ --font-path resources/fonts` to compile the thesis
- Alternatively, you can run `typst watch thesis.typ --font-path resources/fonts` to preview the result as you type

Do **NOT** use it in the official Typst web app because it will take forever to load every time you open the document.

## TODO

- ~Tables and images, including captions~
- ~Footnotes~
- ~Bibliography~
- ~English version~
- Upload to the official template repo

## Acknowledgement

This template is based on lucifer1004's *excellent* project [pkuthss-typst](https://github.com/lucifer1004/pkuthss-typst). It did most of the dirty job and helped me understand Typst and templates.
